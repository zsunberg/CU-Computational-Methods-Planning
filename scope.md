## Skills

(I know these read more like outcomes than skills, but I didn't want to just repeat the concepts. We probably should narrow the concepts down more before writing detailed skills.)

    - Correctness
    - Complexity
    - Accuracy
- Translating a concrete engineering problem into a computational problem (perhaps not essential because they do this in other classes) [Highly desirable]
- Defining an algorithms that operationalizes a methods studied in the course [Highly desirable]
- Implementing an algorithm as an efficient computer program [Essential]
- Using code written by others and writing code for others to use [Somewhat desirable]
- Finding and implementing an algorithm to solve an engineering problem without previous exposure to the algorithm [Highly desirable]
- Using a computer to solve a simple example of the following problems:
    - Systems of linear algebraic equations [Essential]
