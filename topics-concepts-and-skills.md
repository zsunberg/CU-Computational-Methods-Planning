## Skills

> [!NOTE]
> Skills are a work in progress! I have not had a chance to develop the skills yet.

A skill is a practical ability to apply concepts to solve problems, analyze systems, or design solutions.  It focuses on application - what a student can do with their knowledge attained in a class.

- Reasoning about an algorithm apart from implementation (i.e. with pseudocode) [Essential]
    - Correctness
    - Complexity
    - Accuracy
- Translating a concrete engineering problem into a computational problem (perhaps not essential because they do this in other classes) [Highly desirable]
- Defining an algorithms that operationalizes a methods studied in the course [Highly desirable]
- Implementing an algorithm as an efficient computer program [Essential]
    - Profiling
- Using code written by others and writing code for others to use [Somewhat desirable]
- Finding and implementing an algorithm to solve an engineering problem without previous exposure to the algorithm [Highly desirable]
- Using a computer to solve a simple example of the following problems:
    - Systems of linear algebraic equations [Essential]
    - Systems of nonlinear algebraic equations [Somewhat desirable]
    - Ordinary differential equations [Essential]
    - Partial differential equations [Highly desirable]
    - Optimization problems [Highly desirable]
    - Regression problems [Essential]
