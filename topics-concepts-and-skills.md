# Scope of ASEN 3502: Computational Methods

## Definitions
- A *topic* is a broad subject area or category of study within a course. It provides the context or "bucket" for learning.
- A *concept* is a fundamental idea, principle, or relationship that helps explain how things work within a topic. It builds understanding of the theory behind engineering phenomena.
- A *skill* is a practical ability to apply concepts to solve problems, analyze systems, or design solutions.  It focuses on application - what a student can do with their knowledge attained in a class.

> [!NOTE] The concept definition seems to imply that concepts should be grouped by topic, but based on John's comments in Issue #7, I have abandoned this hierarchy.
