# Scope of ASEN 3502: Computational Methods

## Topics

A topic is a broad subject area or category of study within a course.  It provides the context or “bucket” for learning.

For example, in ASEN 3402: Aerospace Heat Transfer, conduction, radiation, and convention are topics.

- Analysis of algorithms [Essential]
- Numerical solution of systems of linear algebraic equations [Essential]
- Numerical solution of nonlinear algebraic equations [Essential]
- Numerical solution of differential equations [Essential]
- Numerical Optimization [Essential]
- Regression [Essential]
- Error analysis and control [Essential]
- Programming [Essential]

## Concepts

A concept is a fundamental idea, principle, or relationship that helps explain how things work within a topic. It builds understanding of the theory behind engineering phenomena.

Concepts are being developed in [this google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NU_O-n32ccqgSSqnjh-YYHleyFIDzCBkznIUxrpPsAk/edit?usp=sharing) (you will need your CU account to access it).

> [!NOTE]
> I assigned each concept to a "seed" topic, but, since most concepts have an Error Analysis and Control component, I did not use that as a seed topic.

> [!NOTE]
> In the CLO table, I am least confident about the Evaluation CLO. I basically linked concepts to this CLO if I could think of a theoretical basis for evaluating them. This is not very rigorous or reliable.

## Skills

> [!NOTE]
> Skills are a work in progress! I have not had a chance to develop the skills yet.

A skill is a practical ability to apply concepts to solve problems, analyze systems, or design solutions.  It focuses on application - what a student can do with their knowledge attained in a class.

- Reasoning about an algorithm apart from implementation (i.e. with pseudocode) [Essential]
    - Correctness
    - Complexity
    - Accuracy
- Translating a concrete engineering problem into a computational problem (perhaps not essential because they do this in other classes) [Highly desirable]
- Defining an algorithms that operationalizes a methods studied in the course [Highly desirable]
- Implementing an algorithm as an efficient computer program [Essential]
- Using code written by others and writing code for others to use [Somewhat desirable]
- Finding and implementing an algorithm to solve an engineering problem without previous exposure to the algorithm [Highly desirable]
- Using a computer to solve a simple example of the following problems:
    - Systems of linear algebraic equations [Essential]
    - Systems of nonlinear algebraic equations [Somewhat desirable]
    - Ordinary differential equations [Essential]
    - Partial differential equations [Highly desirable]
    - Optimization problems [Highly desirable]
    - Regression problems [Essential]
