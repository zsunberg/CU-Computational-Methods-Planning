# Scope of ASEN 3502: Computational Methods

## Topics

A topic is a broad subject area or category of study within a course.  It provides the context or “bucket” for learning.

For example, in ASEN 3402: Aerospace Heat Transfer, conduction, radiation, and convention are topics.

- Analysis of algorithms [Essential]
- Numerical solution of systems of linear algebraic equations [Essential]
- Numerical solution of nonlinear algebraic equations [Essential]
- Numerical solution of differential equations [Essential]
- Numerical Optimization [Essential]
- Regression [Essential]
- Error analysis and control [Essential]
- Programming [Essential]

## Concepts

A concept is a fundamental idea, principle, or relationship that helps explain how things work within a topic. It builds understanding of the theory behind engineering phenomena.

See [concepts.csv](concepts.csv) for the full list of concepts organized by topic.



## Skills

A skill is a practical ability to apply concepts to solve problems, analyze systems, or design solutions.  It focuses on application - what a student can do with their knowledge attained in a class.

For example, calculating the rate of heat loss through a wall using Fourier’s law of heat conduction is a skill within ASEN 3402.  Employing control volume analysis to tackle heat transfer problems is also a skill - and arguably the most important skill developed in ASEN 3402.  It should be noted students will be learning how to apply control volume analysis in ASEN 3402’s prerequisite ASEN 2402: Thermodynamics, so we will be reinforcing this skill in ASEN 3402 and applying it to a new class of problems.
