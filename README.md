# CU Computational Methods Planning

This is the repository for open-source planning of ASEN 3502: Computational Methods at CU Boulder.

Feel free to peruse the .md files as they are being refined. If you have a suggestion, file an issue or suggest a change directly on this website. I'm looking forward to input from all faculty!
