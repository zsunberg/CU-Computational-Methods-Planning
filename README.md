This is the repository for open-source planning of ASEN 3502: Computational Methods at CU Boulder.

## Key Documents

- [Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)](course-learning-outcomes.md)

Feel free to peruse the .md files as they are being refined. If you have a suggestion, file an issue or suggest a change directly on this website. I'm looking forward to input from all faculty!
