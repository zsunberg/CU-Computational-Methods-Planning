# Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) for ASEN 3502: Computational Methods

After taking the course, students should be able to:
1. [**Numerical Methods**] Apply and interpret numerical methods for solving computational problems typically encountered in aerospace engineering, including algebraic systems, differential equations, optimization, and regression.
2. [**Problem Formulation**] Formulate aerospace engineering problems as mathematical problems appropriate for computational solution.
3. [**Evaluation**] Evaluate and communicate about the appropriateness of computational methods for a particular task in terms of computational cost, order of accuracy, implementation complexity, and stability.
4. [**Implementation**] Implement algorithms in an efficient and maintainable manner as an individual and as part of a team.
5. [**Self-Learning**] Discover, implement, verify, and apply self-taught computational methods not covered in class. 

## CLO to PLO Mapping Matrix

According to the new curriculum plan, 3502 should map to PLOs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. (Email: "Undergraduate Curriculum Committee Homework Assignment" 9/18/25)
