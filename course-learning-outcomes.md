# Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) for ASEN 3502: Computational Methods

After taking the course, students should be able to:
1. [Numerical Methods] Apply numerical methods to solve linear and nonlinear systems of algebraic equations, differential equations, optimization problems, and regression problems including basic machine learning.
2. [Problem Formulation] Formulate mathematical problems for modeling, simulating, designing, and controlling aerospace systems.
3. [Evaluation] Evaluate and communicate about the appropriateness of computational methods for a particular task in terms of computational efficiency, correctness, and accuracy.
4. [Implementation] Implement algorithms in an efficient and maintainable manner as an individual and as part of a team.
5. [Self-Learning] Discover, implement, verify, and apply self-taught computational methods not covered in class. 

## CLO to PLO Mapping Matrix

According to the new curriculum plan, 3502 should map to PLOs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. (Email: "Undergraduate Curriculum Committee Homework Assignment" 9/18/25)
